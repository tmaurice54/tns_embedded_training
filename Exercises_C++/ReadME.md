## How to build, flash and debug

You can see [here](../Docs/C%2B%2B_configuration.md) how to build and flash the exercises.
And you can also see how to [debug](../Docs/use_ozone.md) using Ozone and the [UART](../Docs/debug_with_uart.md).

## How to use Renode and run the tests

You have [here](../Docs/use_renode_robotframework.md) all the informations needed.
