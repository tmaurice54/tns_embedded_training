# Exercise the framework Embassy

The framework Embassy uses async/await to allows easy and efficient multitasking in embedded systems.
This project also contains lot of differents batteries such as embassy-stm32 wich is a HAL for stm32 board, or such as embassy::time which provides Instant, Duration and Timer types.

In this exercise we will use entirely use embassy to create tasks and control the user led and button.

At the time this training is created, this project is still in progress and need to be build in nightly mode.
But the project can be now in stable mode, or maybe in a new version that need some modifications of this exercise.
